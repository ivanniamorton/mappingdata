        For senior citizens, walking to the subway can prove impossible. This map shows the six senior-only public housing buildings owned by NYCHA in Manhattan in relation to subway stations. The NYCHA buildings on this map (with the exception of
        the Robbins Plaza which is 0.1 miles) are around 0.3-0.4 miles away from the nearest station.

        Walking distance for seniors needs to be at the forefront of urban planning. The mileage may sound short, but with stations that also aren’t completely ADA accessible, this can leave the elderly NYCHA residents out of luck.

        “There is an assumption in transportation planning that people typically won't walk more than half a mile to transit. Of course, if you're talking about seniors, the distance is surely less,” says Sarah M. Kaufman, Associate Director of the
        NYU Rudin Center for Transportation.
